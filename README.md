# Interview Questions

These are some of the interview questions I was given in my coding interview. 
I have both C++ and Python examples. (I went back and did some problems for both) 

# Demo
I might create a series and walk-through them on youtube. 


# Notice 
I highly suggest trying to code these without looking at my code. 
Some of these problems I coded in minuets and might not have used the 
best practice or the most efficent method. Let me know if you find better
ways of doing them :)
